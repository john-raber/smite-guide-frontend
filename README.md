# SmiteGuide

After playing Smite for X weeks/months/years, experienced players have a level
of understanding of what each god in the game can do and what gods can counter a
specific god's abilities. I have tried to get some of my friends to get into
the game and the biggest challenge in getting them to play is the knowledge
barrier.

There are currently 98 gods in Smite and that number is constantly growing, so
the knowledge gap between experienced players and someone who is just picking up
the game is constantly growing. SmiteGuide is a site where experienced Smite
players can share their knowledge of the game with those who are just getting
started and learning the game.
